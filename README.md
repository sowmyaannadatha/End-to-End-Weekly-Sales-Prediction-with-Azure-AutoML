Project - End-to-End Sales Forecasting Pipeline – Walmart Sales Dataset (Kaggle)


Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast


I developed a complete end-to-end sales forecasting pipeline for the Walmart dataset using Azure AutoML, showcasing hands-on experience with cloud-based automated machine learning.

Key highlights:

Data Preparation & Feature Engineering: Processed historical sales data, engineered features to capture trends, seasonality, and promotions.

Automated Model Training: Leveraged Azure AutoML to train and compare multiple regression models efficiently, producing a robust baseline without manual hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation & Insights: Measured predictive performance using R², ensuring the model reliably captures sales patterns.

Local Deployment: Deployed the final model locally for reproducible predictions and practical business application.

Impact: Translated complex datasets into actionable insights, demonstrating the ability to combine automated ML, predictive modeling, and deployment in a business context.

Skills Demonstrated: Azure AutoML, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Regression Modeling, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Local Deployment.
